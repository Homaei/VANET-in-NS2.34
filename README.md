# VANET-in-NS2.34

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the simulation of Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) using the Network Simulator version 2.34 (NS2.34). VANETs are a pivotal component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), facilitating communication between vehicles and between vehicles and roadside equipment. The focus of this project is to provide a comprehensive simulation environment within NS2.34 for VANET protocols, aiming to enhance research and development in this critical field.

## About the Repository

The repository contains the source code necessary to simulate a VANET protocol within the NS2.34 all-in-one package. This includes modifications and additions to the standard NS2.34 incorporating VANET-specific functionalities and scenarios. The source code is designed for researchers, educators, and students studying or developing VANET-related protocols and applications.

### Key Features

- Custom VANET protocol implementation in NS2.34.
- **Improved Routing by Genetic Algorithm:** The routing efficiency in VANETs has been significantly enhanced by integrating a Genetic Algorithm. This optimization technique improves the routing process by selecting the most efficient paths based on a set of criteria, including but not limited to distance, speed, and traffic conditions. Genetic Algorithms allow dynamic adaptation to changing network conditions, ensuring optimal communication between vehicles.
- Example simulation scenarios and configurations.
- Detailed comments within the code for easier understanding and modification.

## Mini Video Tutorial

A mini video tutorial titled "VANET Execution in the NAM" is included to demonstrate how to execute a VANET simulation in the NS2.34 environment using the Network Animator (NAM). This video serves as a practical guide to running your first simulation and visualizing the behavior of VANET protocols within the simulator.

To view the video, please download the `VANET Execution in the NAM.webm` file from this repository and play it using any media player that supports the WebM video format.

## Getting Started

To get started with VANET simulation in NS2.34:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that NS2.34 all-in-one is properly installed on your system.
3. Replace the necessary NS2.34 files with the modified versions from this repository.
4. Follow the instructions in the documentation (if available) to set up your first VANET simulation scenario.
